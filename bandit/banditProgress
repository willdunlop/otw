Really good for identifying files and decompressing them until you reach a readable format.

Method: Revert the hex dump using 'xxd' and check the file type with 'file'. Use the appropriate decompression methods for each file type.
        Decompression methods include 'tar', 'gzip', and 'bzip2'. Check the man pages for using the commands correctly

Had to submit 14's password to the current level on port 30000.
I had to look it up :( but all that had to be done was an echo piped by a netcat connection

    echo '4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e' | nc localhost 30000


#   Bandit16
Using nmap 'nmap localhost -p 31000-32000' I was able to get a list of open ports.

Open Ports: 31046 31518 31691 31790 31960

I didnt properly identify the ports past this stage, I simply attempted each port with the netcat approach and the s_client approach. Eventually I revieved a private key with port 31790

echo cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790


#   Bandit18
Logged in with ssh the normal way but used a sh session instead
'ssh -t bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 /bin/sh'
Then read the appropriate file
